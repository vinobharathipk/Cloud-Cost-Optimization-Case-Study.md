# Cloud Cost Optimization Case Study

## Overview

**Company:** ABC Retail Corp  
**Industry:** Retail/E-Commerce  
**Cloud Provider:** AWS  
**Annual Cloud Spend:** $2.5 million  
**Objective:** Reduce cloud costs by at least 30% without impacting performance or security.

---

## Background

ABC Retail Corp migrated its infrastructure to AWS in 2021 to support rapid business growth and scalability. Over time, cloud costs increased sharply, especially due to underutilized resources, lack of governance, and evolving business needs. The CTO initiated a cost optimization project to regain financial efficiency.

---

## Challenges

- **Underutilized EC2 instances:** Many VMs ran at low CPU/memory utilization.
- **Unmanaged EBS volumes:** Old volumes persisted after app decommission.
- **Unoptimized storage tiers:** S3 data stored in expensive tiers.
- **Idle Elastic Load Balancers and IPs:** Resources left running without traffic.
- **Lack of cost monitoring:** No alerting or usage visibility for teams.
- **Over-provisioned RDS databases:** Databases sized for peak, rarely needed.

---

## Optimization Steps

### 1. **Assessment & Discovery**
- Used AWS Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, and CloudWatch to analyze cost breakdown.
- Identified top spenders by service (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, EBS).

### 2. **Rightsizing Resources**
- Downsized EC2 instances after workload profiling.
- Implemented auto-scaling groups to adjust capacity dynamically.
- Migrated some workloads to serverless (AWS Lambda).

### 3. **Storage Optimization**
- Moved infrequently accessed S3 objects to Glacier and S3 IA.
- Deleted obsolete EBS volumes and snapshots.
- Enabled S3 Lifecycle policies.

### 4. **Resource Cleanup**
- Decommissioned unused load balancers, IPs, and test environments.
- Automated orphaned resource detection using scripts.

### 5. **Reserved & Spot Instances**
- Converted predictable workloads to Reserved Instances.
- Leveraged Spot Instances for batch and non-critical jobs.

### 6. **Cost Monitoring & Governance**
- Established budgets and cost alerts for teams.
- Adopted tagging policies for cost allocation.
- Monthly cost review meetings.

## Results

| Optimization Area      | Monthly Savings | Actions Taken         |
|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| EC2 Rightsizing       | $28,000         | Instance downsizing  |
| Storage Optimization  | $12,000         | S3 tiering, EBS del  |
| Reserved/Spot Usage   | $18,000         | RI & Spot adoption   |
| Resource Cleanup      | $7,000          | Decom, automation    |
| **Total Monthly**     | **$65,000**     |                      |

**Annualized Savings:** $780,000 (31% of total cloud spend)
